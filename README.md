There are two subdirectories: [BayOpt](https://github.com/vietanhle0101/MPC-BayesOpt-Mixed-Traffic-Automated-Driving/tree/main/BayOpt) for learning the optimal weight adaptation strategy with Bayesian optimization, and [Sim](https://github.com/vietanhle0101/MPC-BayesOpt-Mixed-Traffic-Automated-Driving/tree/main/Sim) for using the learned optimal weight adaptation strategy in real-time control.
